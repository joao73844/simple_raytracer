// IMPORTANT NOTE
/// This Class does NOT BELONG to the tutorial
/// it was made so the intersection algorithmns
/// used in the "3D Programming" Course lectures
/// work, with this ray tracer
/// If you want to use this implementation
/// change the __CLASS_ALGORITHMN__ constant to TRUE
/// (Its defined in the "Source.h" File)
// DESCRIPTION
/// This class implements a Intersection Point
/// between the Rays (from the Ray Tracer) and
/// the Scene Objects
/// It is called inside the "findIntersection"
/// method in each of the Objects and returns 
// ATTRIBUTES
/// This class has 2 attributes, the intersection
/// point and the normal of the intersection point
/// with the center of the sphere
